My name is Eqra Khattak. I am an artist, book lover, seasons binge watcher and a damn nerd. I'm a software engineer with a passion for building beautiful user experiences and solving challenging problems. I've been a [Google Developer Student Club](https://gdsc.community.dev/comsats-university-attock-campus/) Lead at my campus for batch 2020-21. Now I'm a GDSC Mentor. I've also been a part of [GDG Kolachi](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-kolachi/). I'm a supporter of Women In Tech, Black Lives Matter, people of color, people with disabilities, and other marginalized groups. I am a change maker volunteering for [We Make Change](https://www.wemakechange.org).
